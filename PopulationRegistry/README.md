## Overview

- `Person`: Maintains details such as name, identification number, and other personal details.
- `Address`: Represents the address details related with a person.
- `Citizenship`: Represents citizenship information.
- `FamilyRelation`: Describes family relations between individuals.

Each class is constrained to a maximum of ten attributes.

## Language

## Testing
Full business logic implementation hasn't been implemented, but some functionalities are demonstrated via JUnit tests and in the Main class.
