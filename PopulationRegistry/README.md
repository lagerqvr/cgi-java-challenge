# PopulationRegistry

## Overview
This showcase project implements a set of Java backend classes that model a small system for maintaining basic personal information for natural persons. The focus is on the design of domain classes within a limited scope.

## Classes
The system consists of the following classes:
- `Person`: Maintains essential details such as name, identification number, and other personal details.
- `Address`: Represents the address details associated with a person.
- `Citizenship`: Represents citizenship information.
- `FamilyRelation`: Describes family relations between individuals.

Each class is constrained to a maximum of ten attributes.

## Language
The codebase uses English for naming and documentation.

## Testing
While full business logic implementation is beyond the scope, some functionalities are demonstrated via JUnit tests.
