# MinimumGapAlgorithm

## Overview
This project contains a Java implementation of an algorithm that calculates the minimum gap between consecutive integers in an array. It demonstrates simple algorithmic problem-solving and unit testing with JUnit.

## Functionality
The `MinimumGapAlgorithm` class provides a static method that:

- Accepts an array of integers.
- Assumes all array elements are natural numbers.
- Returns the minimum gap that can fit between any two elements in the array.

## Requirements
The algorithm:

- Handles arrays regardless of the order of numbers.
- Works correctly with arrays containing duplicate numbers.
- Operates consistently with arrays that have multiple equal-length gaps.
- Work correctly even with negative numbers
